hexgui
======

Small tool for looking at the binary representation of hexadecimal numbers. This was initially created to sort out subvalues of e.g. 32-bit registers which contain multiple number of smaller sub-fields.

How to use
----------

Paste or enter a hexadecimal value in the topmost field. The binary representation will show up just below it. To display the value stored in a subrange of the binary representation just mark a range by clicking and dragging over the binary string.
